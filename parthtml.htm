        <p>
        Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os 
        is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who 
        take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three
        grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing
        three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or 
        diagonal row is the winner.
        </p> 
        <p>The first chance is of X then chance ox O comes.</p>
